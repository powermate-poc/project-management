# ADR: Use Appium for Mobile Test Automation

## Status: 
Accepted

## Context:
As part of our software development process, we need to implement an automated testing framework for mobile applications to ensure their reliability and quality. After evaluating various options, two potential tools have emerged: Appium and Selenium with Selendroid.

## Appium:
**Pros:**

- Cross-platform support
- Wide language support.
- Compatibility with WebDriver
- Large community and active development
- Support for native, hybrid, and mobile web applications

**Cons:**

- Setup and configuration complexity
## Selendroid:

**Pros:**

- Familiarity for Selenium users
- Compatibility with WebDriver

**Cons:**

- Limited support and development
- Lack of cross-platform support
## Decision:
After careful consideration, the team has chosen to adopt Appium as our mobile test automation tool. The primary reasons for this decision are its cross-platform support, wide language compatibility, and active development community. Appium's flexibility in testing different types of mobile applications aligns well with our project's requirements. While Selendroid might be more familiar for teams experienced with Selenium, its limited support and lack of cross-platform capabilities make it less suitable for our needs. Though Appium's setup and configuration may present some initial challenges, the benefits it offers outweigh the effort required to implement it effectively.
