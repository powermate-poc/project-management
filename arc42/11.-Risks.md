## Inadequate prioritization of "Phone as a Data Collection Device"

Due to inadequate prioritization of the "Phone as a Data Collection Device" in our MVP, described in [Chapter 8 under the section device](./08.-Concepts#device), we did not manage to provide a stable-working solution for this issue. The task priorities were determined based on importance and feasibility within the available resources of the team, due to a limited workforce and a need for quick solutions.

Since the Raspberry Pi provided a quick and effective solution, it took precedence. While the Raspberry Pi development progressed, the team focused on other critical tasks such as data visualization. This further delayed the implementation of data collection using the phone.

When the frontend team regrouped to work on phone data collection, unexpected challenges emerged. The incompatibility between AWS IoT Core and our React Native setup posed a major obstacle, particularly the inability to send certificates via MQTT for authentication.

Under time constraints and pressure to deliver the MVP, we decided to deliver a small proof of concept for phone data collection. While it functions adequately, it requires further refinement to ensure robustness and seamless adaptability to different environments. These limitations were communicated to our client.
Acknowledging this technical debt is crucial to ensure it receives the necessary attention and resources in future iterations. Addressing this debt will enhance the system's overall quality and functionality.

## HTTP Data Ingress

During the implementation of the "Phone as a Data Collection Device" feature, we encountered a challenge related to data transfer between the application and the IoT Core. Initially, we planned to build a fork of the [Paho Client for react native](https://github.com/robhogan/react-native-paho-mqtt).

After implementing and testing with a local broker, we encountered a connection issue with the IoT Core. This problem arose due to the inability to provide the necessary certificates required by AWS in the React Native environment.

A less cost-effective alternative solution was introduced to overcome this obstacle. Workarounds were implemented by transmitting data through HTTP to lambda functions. This intermediary component, called "HTTP Data Ingress," sent data to our SQS and used the already existing lambda authentication instead of the certificates.

Nevertheless, this "HTTP Data Ingress" approach introduced additional complexity and technical debt. To mitigate these risks and address the underlying problem effectively, it is necessary to consider expanding the functionality of the MQTT library. Thus, we can solve the certificate management issue in a more robust, simpler, and cost-effective manner.

By addressing this technical debt and improving MQTT integration, we can enhance the overall reliability, security, and efficiency of the data transfer process between the application and IoT Core. A proactive approach will lead to a more stable, scalable solution aligned with best practices and reducing long-term risks.

## Insecure Database Passthrough Endpoint

During the application development process, there was a need to quickly retrieve data from the database and deliver it to the frontend. To address this requirement, a decision was made to create an endpoint connecting directly to the database and returned the database response.

However, this approach resulted in a highly insecure endpoint that had direct read-only access to the database. It is important to note that exposing direct access to the database is a security risk and should never be done in a production environment. In our case, since we did not have any sensitive data, it was a risk we were willing to take in order to speed up the development process of our MVP.

Following experimentation and user feedback, the temporary endpoint was supposed to be replaced. Unfortunately, due to limited time and resources, there was insufficient capacity to implement different endpoints or adapt queries as needed.

In order to solve this technical debt, it is necessary to implement proper security measures as well as refactor database access. Addressing this debt in future iterations is crucial to ensure a secure and robust system that adheres to best practices for database access. This system protects sensitive data.

## User Auth

By implementing a single power user account, we deviated from the recommended security practice of granting users only the necessary permissions for their specific tasks and data access.

Maintaining the integrity and security of our application requires addressing this technical debt. By doing so, we can enable the support for individualized consumption graphs and user-based data, such as an association between users and devices. These all are essential feature for releasing the system to production.

## Magnet data to Rotations

The in [section 8](./08.-Concepts.md) described [magnet data to gas consumption rate conversion](./08.-Concepts#rotation-conversion) is not 100% stable.
The conversion is based on the assumption that the magnet is rotating around a single axis, which is not always the case, depending on the placement of the gas meter.

Thus it is possible that the single axis approach does not work for some gas meters.

A different approach would be to utilize the absolute value of the magnetic field strength, which could be independent of the rotation axis.

However, this has proven to be more difficult in our tests, and is thus not yet implemented.

Another problem not solved by this approach would however not solve the following problem:

In some cases the magnet stops, due to no gas consumption, at a certain point where it exactly on the threshold value and triggers multiple rotations.

Other approaches found online used:

1. [Reed contacts](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reed-contact)
   1. Contains a physical switch that moves due to the magnetic field, and triggers once a threshold is reached.
   2. However, the binary output is not more accurate than the chosen method
   3. Physical moving parts are more prone to failure
2. [Hall sensor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hall_effect_sensor)
   1. Effectively a digital magnetometer
   2. Could help with orientation issues, but so would using the absolute value of the magnetic field strength
   3. Needs research if better
3. [3-Axis Magnetometer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetometer), The current solution approach
   1. Most accurate solution
   2. Existing solution approaches, such as this [blogpost](https://www.kompf.de/tech/gascountmag.html)
   3. Still very cheap
   4. Accurate measurements
   5. Introduces axis complexity
