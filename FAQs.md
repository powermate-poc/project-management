- What are Heating Degree Days?
  - Heating Degree Days is the measurement to tell the resident when the building does not need heat if the outside temperature is higher than a certain degree, while the resident still can live in comfort. In the European Union, the threshold of a certain degree is 15.5 degree celsius.
- Why are Heating Degree Days important?
  - Using the gas for heating recklessly will waste the gas and cost the resident extra money. Heating Degree Days can help the resident to have a sense to decide the gas usage so that the gas can be used only if the resident needs it.
- Are other consumptions than gas supported such as electricity or solar?
  - The powermate project is developed in such a way and planning to extend into different aspects of consumption, such as electricity and solar.
- What if I move to a new house? Can I still use the sensor and app? 
  - Yes, you can still use the sensor and app if you move to a new house. Simply follow the instructions in the app to set up the device againt at your new location.
- Are self-hosting capabilities taken into account?
  - This could be a possibility that is yet to be decided.
- How much does it cost to have PowerMate setup for my single gas meter home?
  - The app itself is free and contains a free plan. For longer data history and detailed insights a small monthly fee of X $/month is required. We only use this money to finance our servers. One device itself costs about X $ per device. Optionally you can use your own device or an old smartphone with the device-substitute mode enabled and set it up with our guide, then you do not have to pay for a device.

# App

- How do I monitor my gas consumption using the app? 
  - Once the device is setup according to instructions in the app or on our [website](powermate-project.app), you can monitor your gas consumption in real-time using the app.
- Can I switch the period of the collected consumption?
  - Yes, we enable to look into different time periods of collected data.
- Can I access my gas consumption data from multiple devices? 
  - Yes, you can access your gas consumption data from any device with the app installed and logged in into your account.
- How often is the gas consumption data updated in the app? 
  - TBD
- Where can I download the powermate app?
  - We plan to release the app in every regular app store (i.e. Apple App store, Google Play Store)
- Can I set alerts for high gas consumption? 
  - Yes, you can set alerts for high gas consumption in the app. You will receive a notification if your gas consumption exceeds the threshold you set.
- Can I export my gas consumption data? 
  - Yes, you can export your gas consumption data from the app in a variety of formats for further analysis or record keeping.
- Can I share my gas consumption data with others? 
  - Yes, you can do so by sharing the access to your PowerMate account with other people. Further possibilities such as sharing access to data collected from a device to a different account as of now are evaluated and are yet to be decided.
- What if I have more than one gas meter in my house? Can I monitor them all using the app? 
  - Yes, a PowerMate account can have more than one device associated.
- How does PowerMate know my gas consumption in kWh?
  - We calculate consumption (with some precision loss) based on rotations observed from the gas meter with the sensor on the device.
- For what OS is the PowerMate app available
  - Please refer to our [website](powermate-project.app) for a list of supported operating systems for the app.
- How can I interpret the data I see in the PowerMate App?
  - We can give directions, but cannot tell you what machine in your system caused what spike
- Does PowerMate predict or compare my gas consumption?
  - Your Eco Score shows you the comparison between your gas consumption and the average consumption. Predictions can be found at the *prediction* tab in the app.

# Device

- Where can I buy hardware?
  - Checkout our [website](powermate-project.app).
- How do I install the gas meter sensor?
  - The sensor can be easily attached to your gas meter. Simply follow the instructions in the app or our [website](powermate-project.app).
- Is the sensor compatible with all types of gas meters? 
  - No, the current sensor and services are only designed for BK-G4 gas meters specifically. Applying the sensor to other types of gas meter might cause biased measurement.
- What kind of hardware do I need if I want to set this up by myself?
  - You can use an old phone and have the app installed with the device-substitute mode enabled, buy hardware devices with recommended specs referenced on our website, or buy the device directly from our [website](powermate-project.app). If you decide to use your own smartphone to collect the data, please make sure that your smartphone is listed in our supported devices list on our [website](powermate-project.app).
- How do I connect the device to my WiFi network? 
  - You can connect the sensor to your WiFi network using our powermate smartphone app. Just follow the steps in the app to set up the connection.
- Do I have to buy sensors for my gas meter myself?
  - No, our plug-and-collect ready device that can be bought on our [website](powermate-project.app) already integrated the correct sensor needed.
- Is there a limit to how many devices I can connect to the app? 
  - There is no limit on devices you can setup for yourself. Though, one device can only foster one sensor.
- What if I have trouble connecting the device to my WiFi network? 
  - If you have trouble connecting the sensor to your WiFi network, please refer to the troubleshooting section in the app or contact our customer support for assistance at services@powermate-project.app. 
- What happens if my WiFi network goes down? 
  - If your WiFi network goes down, the sensor will store the data locally until the connection is restored. Once the connection is restored, the data will be synced with the app.
